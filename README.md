# Convex + TypeScript + ESLint + Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

This template provides a minimal setup to get Convex working, with TypeScript,
ESLint and React using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Start by editing `convex/myFunctions.ts` and interact with your React app.

npm create convex@latest -t react-vite-shadcn
